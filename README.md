### Getting and Cleaning Data 
### Peer Review Assignment

## Goal of the Project

  1. A tidy data set 
  2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis 
  3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data        called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the           scripts work and how they are connected.
  4. Analysis R Script
